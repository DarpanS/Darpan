The Equivalent circuit can be divided into 5 parts, namely:
1.	Microcontroller
2.	IR transmitter-receiver pair
3.	LDR circuit
4.	LM 324 assembly
5.	Power LED 

Microcontroller:
The circuit’s heart is “Microcontroller”. We are planning to use Atmega32 development board in our projects due to following features:
1.	High performance, Low-power AVR *-bit Microcontroller
2.	Non-volatile Program and Data memories
-1024 EEPROM
    (Endurance: 100k write/erase cycles)
 -32K bytes of In-System Self-Programmable Flash
    (Endurance: 10k write/erase cycles)
3.	I/O and packages
•	32 Programmable I/O  Lines
•	40 –pin PDIP ,44-lead TQFP and 44-pad QFN/MLF
        4.  Speed Grades
•	-0-8 MHz for Atmega32L
•	-0-16 MHz for Atmega32
        5. Special Microcontroller Features
•	Internal Calibrated RC Oscillator
•	External and Internal  Interrupt Sources
•	Power –on Reset and Programmable Brown -out Detection
         6. Power Consumption at 1 MHz, 3V, 25 ‘C for ATmega32L
•	Active:1.1mA
•	Idle Mode: 0.35 mA
•	Power-down Mode:< 1uA 

LDR Circuit
The LDR circuit is the light-dependent sensor which increases the resistance of path as the intensity of the incident decreases. This property is used in the project to distinguish between day and night
LM324 Assembly
It is an integrated chip(IC) which consists of quad-op-amp (4 op amps), which acts as comparator for the inputs on the inverting and non-inverting terminals. The basic purpose of LM324 is to convert the analog value of output of IR sensors to a digital form i.e. 0V or +5V, which can be detected by the input/output pins of microcontroller.
IR Transmitter-Receiver Pair
The infrared transmitter LED is linked across a 5V supply in series with a resistor of 270 ohm, while the infrared receiver photo-diode is inversely connected across the 5V supply through a resistor of 10K. The IR transmitter-receiver module that is implemented in the model has a range of 10cm. The purpose of the IR pair is to sense the vehicles and correspondily light the required power LEDs. In a practical implementation, IR sensors must have a sufficient range to detect vehicles. The IR sensors are placed just before the LED posts to light the streets just before the vehicle reached a particular point on the street.
Power LEDs Circuit
The purpose of using power LEDs is to enlighten with minimum resources and less power consuming elements. A reflector along with the power LED can illuminate an enough amount of space, if a proper voltage level is given to the LEDs. The terminals of the power LEDs are connected to the common ground and the PORTD pins (output) of the microcontroller.
